# basic_tron
A basic implementation of the tron game using EasyAI

RULES:
- You are the O
- The AI is the X
- For moving use the keys "w, a, s, d" to move "up, left, down or right" respectively
- If you touch the asterisks "*" you lose and the letter "F" shows in your position
- If you want to make the AI harder, change the argument number inside the AI algorithm declaration
